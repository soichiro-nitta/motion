# Cursor Rules for this repo

## Editing
- Preserve existing indentation style and width.
- Prefer minimal diffs; avoid unrelated reformatting.
- Follow the project TypeScript settings (`tsconfig.json`).

## Commits
- Use conventional commits: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, ci, test, perf.
- Summaries in Japanese when authoring in this repo.

## Release
- Use `pnpm release` (np) to bump version and create tag locally.
- Push with `--follow-tags` to trigger CI publish.
- Do not publish locally; CI publishes on tag via `publish.yml`.

## RSC Guard
- Do not import this library from React Server Components.
- The `react-server` export returns a stub that throws; keep it intact.
